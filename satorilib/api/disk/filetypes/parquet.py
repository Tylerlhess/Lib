# ''' an api for reading and writing to disk '''

# # todo:
# # I originally designed this around parquet files because I was under the
# # impression they were more powerful and allowed for greater flexibility than it
# # turns out they do. I thought you could essentially pull data from disk without
# # reading in the entire file, at least by row and column, and maybe even with
# # more complicated queries. that is not the case. at best you can pull any
# # column, or a group of indeterminate rows totaling about 512 mb, or if you want
# # to transform the df and save that to disk so you can pull the exact row (as a
# # column) that you want, then the file on disk is made exponentially larger. So.
# # I've tried to work around these unfortunate limitations by keeping some data
# # in memory when I'd rather pull it from disk, or just pulling it all from disk
# # on demand, even if I just need one row, or stuff like that. but what I think
# # would be more ideal is to save the data in such a way that we can at least get
# # it incrementally by row, and maybe even save it incrementally by row. then we
# # could save it to disk without this 'aggregate and incrementals distinction'
# # and we could append the hashes directly to the data, and we could grab
# # specific rows. So then the question becomes, what is the best solution for
# # this? I was hoping to find a columnar datastore that was powerful enough, and
# # maybe there is one but it's just not out of the box parquet. Alternatively,
# # there's straight up saving the data as csv files which we can parse,
# # incrementally I believe, if we are willing to research how. Or we can use a
# # legit database, even a simple one like sqlite, though that is all in memory,
# # so that's probably not what we want technically. I think we need to do more
# # research into what solution would be best. Once we have a solution we can
# # re-write this entire module and simplify everything thats made complicated by
# # our current limitations. after some more cursory research I'm finding that csv
# # would basically be my other option if I wanted to stick with a file rather
# # than a database. with csv I can append to it easily and quickly, and read a
# # specific row from it rather quickly (tested 2millionth row took 1 second). but
# # the file is large, much much larger than parquet, and to read the entire file
# # into memory takes a much longer time. than parquet. However. I think this is a
# # classic example of pre-mature optimization. either way I can make work and I
# # should have gone with the easiest: csv. But now that I have the more difficult
# # method already instanteated what should I do? go back and make the easier one?
# # I should have build different types of managers that implement the same api.
