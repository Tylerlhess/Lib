# this uses the websocket-client library and represents a both the subscriber
# and the publisher connection in one. It runs the subscriber in it's own thread
# which means the only downside it has is that it cannot change the on_message
# handler, called router, until after a message has been received. This is a
# limitation, but not a serious one.

# the default router should accept the message and hold it in memory until the
# ipfs sync process is complete. Once it is complete it should send each message
# in reserve to the system that saves it to disk and routes it to the engine.
# since the engine will not even be started until after the router is complete,
# and all messages saved to the disk, this should be fine.
